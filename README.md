### What the hell is ES6?
As described in [this Quora post](https://www.quora.com/What-is-ES6), `ES6` is shorthand for ECMAScript6/ECMAScript2015. ES6 is not a scripting language, it is the set of standards that JavaScript is rooted in.

Here's a brief timeline of JavaScript, as authored by our friends at [webapplog.com](https://webapplog.com/es6/):
1.    1995: JavaScript is born as LiveScript
1.    1997: ECMAScript standard is established
1.    1999: ES3 comes out and IE5 is all the rage
1.    2000â€“2005: XMLHttpRequest, a.k.a. AJAX, gains popularity in app such as Outlook Web Access (2000) and Oddpost (2002), Gmail (2004) and Google Maps (2005)
1.    2009: ES5 comes out (this is what most of us use now) with forEach, Object.keys, Object.create (specially for Douglas Crockford), and standard JSON
1.    2015: ES6/ECMAScript2015 comes out
1.    2017: We're still talking about ES6 like it's fancy and new, even though ES7 has some incredible _new_ features
